# 🌟 **STELLAR PRICE ORACLE**
## *Democratizing DeFi Infrastructure with Ultra-Low Cost Price Feeds*

---

## 💡 **THE PROBLEM**

### **Current Oracle Market is Broken**

**💸 EXPENSIVE**
- ChainLink: **$500+ per deployment**
- Pyth: **$200+ monthly minimums**
- Traditional APIs: **$50-300/month with rate limits**

**🔒 EXCLUSIVE** 
- Only large protocols can afford reliable oracles
- New tokens wait **months** for price feed support
- Emerging markets **completely excluded**

**🐌 SLOW**
- Cross-chain delays: **2-15 minutes**
- High gas fees limit update frequency
- Centralized bottlenecks create single points of failure

### **Real Impact: $2.4B+ DeFi protocols can't afford reliable price feeds**
